# Six Strings and A Laptop (Six Salt) README.

## Overview

### Why does Six Salt?
This website is to promote myself as a musician while simultaneously displaying my coding skills.


### Further thoughts on site design
I wanted to keep a similar aesthetic throughout the site, and provide a friendly user experience, with as little barriers to each task as possible.

### What does the code do?
The code contained in these files will allow Six Salt to run on a local server or hosted on Heroku.

## Features

### Existing Features
Features include the ability to purchase and download my ep, check my availability and book me out for gigs.
