# Six Strings and A Laptop (Six Salt) README.

## Overview

### Why does Six Salt?
This website is to promote myself as a musician while simultaneously displaying my coding skills.


### Further thoughts on site design
I wanted to keep a similar aesthetic throughout the site, and provide a friendly user experience, with as little barriers to each task as possible.

### What does the code do?
The code contained in these files will allow Six Salt to run on a local server or hosted on Heroku.

## Features

### Existing Features
Features include the ability to purchase and download my ep, check my availability and book me out for gigs.

### Getting the code up and running
1. Firstly you will need to clone this repository by running the ```git clone <project's Github URL>``` command
2. After you've done that you'll need to make sure that you have **MongoDB** installed
  1. Treehouse offer a fantastic explanation on downloading and installing **MongoDB** [here](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/mongo-mac.html)
  2. Alternatively, the good folks over at **MongoDB** walk you through installation on Windows [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)
3. Once **MongoDB** is installed, you'll need to install **Flask**
  1. You can find instructions for installing **Flask** for Mac [here](http://www1.cmc.edu/pages/faculty/alee/cs40/penv/installFlaskOnMac.html)
  2. And instructions for installing **Flask** for Windows [here](http://www1.cmc.edu/pages/faculty/alee/cs40/penv/installFlaskOnWindows.html)
4. Once **MongoDB** is installed run ```mongod``` in the command line
6. Run the project in PyCharm. Specifically the not_alone.py file in the project root directory.
7. Once you have done this the project can be found on [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
7. Make changes to the code and if you think it belongs in here then just submit a pull request
